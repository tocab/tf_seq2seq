# tf_seq2seq
Some seq2seq experiments with tensorflow

Added a simple seq2seq example for Tensorflow 1.1.0.

Simple sequence prediction: <br />
A random sequence of integers as input with the goal for the model to predict the same sequence as output.

Simple translator: <br />
Input is a source language and target is to predict text into a target language. 
For using it, change paths in seq2seq_translator.py file and run it!
